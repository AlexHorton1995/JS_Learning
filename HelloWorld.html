    <p>
      This Sandbox Page is for me to show how I will get progressively better at HTML, Javascript and CSS.<br>
      I will show a progression in Javascript after studying one hour at a time for a few weeks.<br>
      All of my work will be checked into my Git repo on Github, and I will make one video a week 
      detailing what I have learned.<br><br>
      This is getting me ready to tackle React/Node.js!

      <h2><u>Lesson 1 (taken from site <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/" target="_blank">Tutorial Republic</a>) - <strong>What is HTML?</strong><br><br></u></h2>

      <strong>HTML</strong> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  HTML pages are what maks up the internet (World Wide Web).  It was created in 1990 by some really smart<br>
      dude somewhere (you can lookup the history on your own time, you're on mine, LOL!).  That's all we will cover there.<br><br>
    </p>

      <h2><u>Lesson 2 (taken from site <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/html-elements.php" target="_blank">Tutorial Republic</a>) - <strong>HTML Elements</strong><br><br></u></h2>

      Html pages are made up of HTML Tags and Elements.

      What is an HTML Element?  An HTML element is the individual component of an HTML document.  It represents semantics.  HTML tags are made up of HTML Elements.<br>
      For example, the &lt;a href&gt; tag is a tag that allows a link to a different webpage.  The tag will dictate the behavior of the html document in that section.<br><br> 

      Here is an example of an &lt;a href&gt; tag at work:<br><br>

      <code>
        &lt;a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/" target="_blank"&gt;Tutorial Republic&lt;/a&gt;
      </code>

      <br><br>

      There are many HTML tags that you can use.  Again, I won't go into all of them because this page is for my benefit, not yours.  Go look em up yourself!

      <input onclick="TypedAlert();" type="button" value="Click Me!" />
